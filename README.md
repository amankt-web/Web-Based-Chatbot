# Web-Based-Chatbot

Certainly! Designing the flow of a rule-based chatbot involves defining the conversation structure, handling user inputs, and generating appropriate responses. Since your chatbot is focused on retrieving information from Wikipedia, I'll outline a simplified flow. Keep in mind that real-world chatbot design can be more complex, and the effectiveness often depends on the specific use case and user interactions. Below is a basic flow for your chatbot:

# Steps follow to run the code in your system
1. open jupyter Notebook
2. create one folder and inside that folder create one ipynb notebook
3. after that copy all the content from wikipedia of chatbot and as usual i created and upload into the data.txt
4. after that i load into my jupyter notebook and done some cleaning and doing some formation and applying nlp, token , lemmization
5. after that trained our model and using some charcters, string formation to integer becuase ML only understand Integer language then,
6. loaded the library and uploaded into it
7. after that for testing our chatbot is working perfect or not i tried asking all that question , which are there in the website
8 and achieved 90% of accuracy on result , but yeah it's in a training mode and rule based so it gives only that answer which is been trained.
